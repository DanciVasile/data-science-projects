Every project follows the same layout: `data/` → `notebooks/` (EDA) → `src/` (training) → `models/` (artefacts) → `reports/figures/` (plots).

## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites — install uv (recommended)

This repo uses [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as the Python package manager.  
uv is **10–100× faster** than pip, handles virtual environments automatically, and locks exact dependency versions for full reproducibility via `uv.lock`.

**Install uv:**

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

> See the [uv installation docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for more options.

### Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanciVasile/data-science-projects.git
cd data-science-projects
.\init.ps1       # installs dependencies + registers Jupyter kernel
```

The `init.ps1` script runs `uv sync` (creates `.venv`) and registers it as a Jupyter kernel named **"Data Science Projects"** so every notebook uses the correct environment out of the box.

Then navigate into any project folder and follow its README.

### Alternative (pip)

If you prefer pip over uv:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # Windows
pip install -e .
```

---

## 🆕 Starting a New Project

Two scripts automate new project creation so every project starts with the same structure and conventions:

### `setup.ps1` — Generate a full project folder

```powershell
mkdir my_new_project; cd my_new_project
& ..\setup.ps1
```

Creates:

```
my_new_project/
├── data/
├── docs/
├── models/
├── notebooks/
│   └── exploration.ipynb   ← generated from EDA template
├── reports/figures/
└── src/
```

### `create_notebook.py` — Generate the EDA notebook only

```bash
uv run create_notebook.py notebooks       # into a subfolder
uv run create_notebook.py                  # into current directory
```

The notebook template includes 10 sections (imports, config, loading, target analysis, missing values, cleaning, univariate EDA, bivariate EDA, outlier detection, summary) with a `TASK` variable that switches between regression and classification behaviour automatically.

---

## 🤖 Automated Notebook Setup

Every generated notebook comes with **two automations** so you (and anyone who clones the repo) can start working immediately — no manual path editing or kernel hunting.

### Automatic data path resolution

The configuration cell resolves the project's `data/` directory automatically, regardless of where the kernel's working directory is set:

| Environment | How it resolves |
|---|---|
| **VS Code** | Uses the `__vsc_ipynb_file__` variable injected by the Jupyter extension |
| **JupyterLab / Classic Jupyter** | Walks up from the kernel's CWD (which Jupyter sets to the notebook's directory) |

**All you need to do** is drop your dataset into the project's `data/` folder and set the filename:

```python
DATA_FILE = "my-dataset.csv"   # ← only thing you change
```

The full path is built automatically:

```python
DATA_PATH = PROJECT_DIR / "data" / DATA_FILE
```

### Automatic kernel selection

Notebooks are pre-configured to use the **"Data Science Projects"** kernel registered by `init.ps1`.  
After running `.\init.ps1` once, every notebook will pick up the correct `.venv` kernel automatically — no need to manually select an interpreter.

> **Tip:** If you open a notebook and the kernel shows "Select Kernel", just run `.\init.ps1` again to re-register it.
